# Guidelines for the implementation of Initial-Trust-aware-BLE-Protocol-for-IoT-Systems

### Brief description: 
Users are concerned about the trustworthiness of the data and services provided by Internet of Things (IoT) systems. An IoT system must verify the initial trust of devices before admitting them to the system and monitor the trustworthiness of every admitted device to guarantee the reliable data and services. Establishing an initial trust between two devices at their first encounter has been a challenge when little or no knowledge is available. Such establishment entails a mechanism for devices to generate initial knowledge about each other, an interaction protocol for conducting the trust knowledge generation, a design of the trust knowledge (information design), and a trust computation scheme. A trust establishment model including the trust knowledge generation mechanism, information design, and trust computation scheme was proposed in our earlier work. This project focuses on the interaction protocol for generating the trust knowledge. We investigate a new initial trust-aware communication protocol, the initial trust-aware Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol, which extends the existing BLE protocol to realize the challenge-response-based trust assessment process. We describe the design and implementation of the initial trust-aware BLE protocol and evaluates its performance. The performance evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of the initial trust-aware BLE protocol.

### NOTICE:
The code was built and tested on the open source BLE simulation tool initiated by Mikhaylov. This tool uses the MiXiM framework (v2.2.1) based on the popular OMNet++ engine (v.4.2.2) to implement the BLE communication protocol.
